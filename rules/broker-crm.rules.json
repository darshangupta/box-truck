    "vision": "Track, engage, and score brokers extracted from load board data to determine which freight is actually bookable. Use this feedback to enrich the dispatch engine's graph and prioritize real-world viable routes.",
    "goals": [
      "Extract and normalize broker data from each scraped load",
      "Store brokers in a Supabase `brokers` table with key contact fields",
      "Track broker engagement in a `broker_engagement` table (status, reply, timestamp)",
      "Build a minimal public-facing landing page with company info and contact form to increase broker trust",
      "Automate outbound broker email outreach based on scraped load data",
      "Log replies and optionally use LLM parsing to classify them as 'interested', 'not available', or 'needs follow-up'",
      "Feed broker engagement scores into load chaining logic to deprioritize unresponsive brokers"
    ],
    "rules": [
      "Each broker must be uniquely identified by MC number if available, otherwise by normalized name + contact info",
      "Brokers must be extracted and deduplicated during scraping and stored separately from loads",
      "A broker's engagement score (0â€“100) is calculated from reply rates, call outcomes, and historical availability",
      "Engagement score should be used as a weight modifier in route scoring (e.g. reduce weight for non-responsive brokers)",
      "Outbound emails should be logged in `broker_engagement` with timestamp, broker ID, load ID, and status",
      "A reply classifier should tag each inbound email with status: 'available', 'unavailable', 'needs call', or 'invalid contact'",
      "Landing page should be hosted publicly with basic brand info, value prop for brokers, and a contact form for manual inbound outreach"
